; register usage during main loop
; DS: 0xB800, segment of screen buffer
; BX: 0x7D0, screen size (40x25x2 bytes), used in food generation, edge checks, also used for screen accesses but constantly reinitialized
; DX: 0x200A, DH used for clearing old snake tiles, DL used for magic IMUL and DX used for wall building
; SI: position of the snake head
; DI: pointer to memory location where the current position of the snake head is stored
; SP: pointer to memory location where the current position of the snake tail is stored
lds di, [BYTE bx+si+0x0] ; SI=0x100 and BX=0x0 at program start, this initializes DS and DI and the 0 serves as a dummy byte for the LDS itself as machine code at 0x100 is 0xC5,0x78,0x00,0xB8

    mov ax, 0x200A       ;   first byte of the instruction is 0xB8 used for LDS, also sets AX to the initial value for DX to swap later: DH set to empty space, DL to 0xA, DX satisfies DX*8%0x10000=0x50 so good for the wall building
