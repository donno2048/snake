; register usage during main loop
; DS: 0xB800, segment of screen buffer
; CX: 0xFA0, size of the screen (80x25x16bit). CH (0xF) is also used as the food character, CL (0xA0) for the snake character and the screen width
; DI: position of the snake head (only every second horizontal position is ever used to compensate the speed difference between horizonal and vertical movements)
; SI: memory location on the stack where the current position of the snake tail is stored
std                        ; set direction flag so LODSW moves SI in the same direction as PUSH moves SP, creating a FIFO buffer of snake cells on the stack
lds cx, [si+0x4]           ; SI=0x100 at program start in most DOS versions, this loads DS and CX with 4 bytes located at the beginning of the next instruction (offset 0x104)
