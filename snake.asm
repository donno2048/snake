; register usage during main loop
; DS: 0xB800, segment of screen buffer
; BX: 0xF9C, screen size (80x25x16bit) - 4, used in food generation, edge checks and for snake character, also used for screen accesses but constantly reinitialized
; DX: 0x20A0, DH (0x20) is the empty character, DL (0xA0) is the screen width
; DI: position of the snake head (only every second horizontal position is ever used to compensate the speed difference between horizonal and vertical movements)
; SI: memory location on the stack where the current position of the snake tail is stored
std                   ; set direction flag so LODSW moves SI in the same direction as PUSH moves SP, creating a FIFO buffer of snake cells on the stack
