; DS: 0xB800, segment of screen buffer
; BX: 0x7D0, screen size (40x25x2 bytes), used in food generation, edge checks, also used for screen accesses but constantly reinitialized

; SI: position of the snake head
; DI: pointer to memory location where the current position of the snake head is stored
; SP: pointer to memory location where the current position of the snake tail is stored
